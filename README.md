# world_happiness


Step-by-Step Guide for World Happiness Project
🧾 Step 1: Understand the Dataset
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Use df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe() to explore:

Columns present

Missing values

Data types

Basic distributions

🔍 Step 2: Data Cleaning
Standardize column names (remove whitespace, lowercase, rename if inconsistent across years).

Check for and handle missing values (df.isnull().sum()).

Convert year column to int if necessary.

Ensure country names are consistent.

📊 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Start with:

Overall distribution of happiness scores

Average happiness score per year

Happiness score by region (if available)

Correlation heatmap among variables (e.g., Economy, Family, Health, Freedom, Generosity, Trust)

Use visuals:

Histograms and boxplots for score distributions

Bar plots for top/bottom 10 happiest countries per year

Line plots for country-wise trends across 2015–2017

Pairplots or scatter plots for variable relationships

📈 Step 4: Key Questions to Answer
Which factors are most correlated with happiness?

Which countries improved or declined in happiness the most over time?

Is GDP strongly linked to happiness?

Do people in freer countries report higher happiness?

🧠 Step 5: Insights and Reporting
Summarize key findings:

What contributes most to happiness?

How does happiness shift geographically or over time?

Make visualizations to support each insight.

📦 Step 6: Optional – Modeling
Try linear regression to predict happiness score from other features.

Evaluate model performance using R², MAE, etc.

📚 Step 7: Wrap-Up
Create a Jupyter Notebook or Python script with:

Cleaned code

Visuals

Markdown cells explaining each section

Prepare a concise README with project purpose, methodology, key findings, and next steps.






---------------

🔑 Summary of Key Findings
✅ What contributes most to happiness?
Economy (GDP per Capita) is the strongest contributor to happiness, with a correlation of 0.785 to the Happiness Score.

Other significant contributors include:

Health (Life Expectancy) → Correlation: 0.748

Family → Correlation: 0.637

Freedom → Correlation: 0.560

Lower influence factors:

Trust (Government Corruption) → 0.282

Generosity → 0.222

🧠 Interpretation:
Wealthier countries tend to be happier, especially when combined with good healthcare, strong family/social support, and personal freedom.

🌍 How does happiness shift geographically or over time?
📈 Top Improvers (2015–2017)
Countries with the most positive change in happiness score:

Latvia (+0.75)

Romania (+0.70)

Togo, Senegal, Gabon, Egypt...

➡️ Most are developing or reforming nations, showing progress in well-being.

📉 Top Decliners (2015–2017)
Countries with the greatest drop in happiness score:

Venezuela (−1.56)

Liberia, Haiti, Zimbabwe, Zambia...

➡️ These countries are experiencing economic, political, or humanitarian crises.

🧠 Interpretation:
Happiness tends to decline sharply in countries undergoing instability or recession, while consistent reforms or development lead to increases in happiness over time.
